MVP project - mv linux command with progress bar

This project has started with the goal of making a new linux "mv" command with a progress bar added to it, 
indicating the ammount of data transfered (in %) and its flow rate (in MB/s).

This project is sure very simple but will be I hope very usefull :)  (some updates are yet to come)
