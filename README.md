# MVP - move or copy files in linux with a progress bar

This project has started with the goal of making a new linux "mv" and "cp" command with a progress bar added to it, 
indicating the ammount of data transfered (in %) and its flow rate (in MB/s).

This project is sure very simple but will be I hope very usefull for people who often move heavy files :) 
(some updates are yet to come and please feel free to give us feedback)

This project is an open source program written in C
